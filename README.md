### Category One Enhancement - Software Design and Engineering
The first artifact in my portfolio:[ Artifact 1 - Jeremy Huesman.zip](https://github.com/jhues97/jhues97.github.io/blob/a30dd3b6e1ae3015fd757c4236b1fe85b4b53077/Artifact%201%20-%20Jeremy%20Huesman.zip), is the 3D scene I created for course CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. The project showcases the software and design skills of the Computer Science program. The user can move about the 3D environment and see the objects from all angles. We learned how to apply textures to our objects so that they would replicate the object correctly. There were improvements and enhancements made to this project. I fixed the lighting and got it working correctly which I ran into issues with during the coursework. I also improved the controls to make movement smoother and easier to control for the user.
