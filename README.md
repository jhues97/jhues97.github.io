### Code Review of the Three Artifacts
INSERT VIDEO

### Category One Enhancement - Software Design and Engineering
Software engineering was a key concept throughout the degree program. An example of the work done is showcased in artifact one of this portfolio. CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization had us set up a scene at our house and take a picture. We then had to take that picture and create it using C++ and OpenGL. We learned to incorporate libraries and adhere to coding best practices when creating our 3D scene. The use of good commenting made it easy to go back and fix the issues I encountered during the project so I could fix and improve them for artifact one. In CS-350 Mobile Architecture and Programming, we had to create a mobile application for Android. We had to use the skills learned in previous courses to create a fully working program to create the application.
