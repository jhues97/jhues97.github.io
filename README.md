## Welcome to Jeremy Huesman's Homepage!
### Professional Self-Assessment

### Self-Assessment
Since starting my computer science course, we have learned various skills and topics. Before starting my course, I had worked on fixing computers for friends and family. I had completed the CompTIA A+ certification before enrolling as I was looking to switch to the technology field. During the degree program, I made this switch to a helpdesk job. The courses have helped me gain more understanding of the workings of computers from a programming point of view. I have been able to move up to another position to continue growing in this new career.

### Collaborating in a Team Environment
Collaborating in a team environment is important at all levels of Information Technology. The collaboration tools and processes we learned about in CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle had us working with agile and waterfall methods. CS-350 Emerging System Architecture and Technology, we worked with more advanced diagramming techniques that are useful for planning our project to keep the team on track. In CS-310 Collaboration and Team project as a class, we worked together making commits to a codebase with GitHub and bitbucket. The classes helped reinforce the need for team collaboration in the workplace.

### Communicating to Stakeholders
The classes referenced in team collaboration also helped reinforce working with the stakeholders and customers. Creating the workflows, charts, and diagrams for the stakeholder’s product provides us with a way to present how we will accomplish what they are requesting. We need to be able to speak in layman’s terms if we are dealing with a non-technical customer and these tools provide a way to visualize the outcome and steps needed to complete the project.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
We were introduced to data structures and algorithms in CS-260 represented as Artifact two during the degree program. Artifact two in my ePortfolio represents this as one of the main categories highlighting its importance in computer science. We worked using these tools to design solutions to the problems given to us. Taking a CSV file and running a binary search tree on it with the provided menu showcases how useful they can be. It allows the user to select from different sorting choices and displays those that fit the criteria. CS-340 Client-Server Development further built upon these concepts to create a system that interacted with a database and provided a G.U.I. on the client-side. During CS-340, we worked on implementing C.R.U.D functions that can be performed on the database from the G.U.I.
### Software Engineering
Software engineering was a key concept throughout the degree program. An example of the work done is showcased in artifact one of this portfolio. CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization had us set up a scene at our house and take a picture. We then had to take that picture and create it using C++ and OpenGL. We learned to incorporate libraries and adhere to coding best practices when creating our 3D scene. The use of good commenting made it easy to go back and fix the issues I encountered during the project so I could fix and improve them for artifact one. In CS-350 Mobile Architecture and Programming, we had to create a mobile application for Android. We had to use the skills learned in previous courses to create a fully working program to create the application.

### Databases
Databases were also a key concept in the degree program. An example of this is represented with artifact three. The course DAD-220 gave us an introduction to working with databases and doing basic C.R.U.D functions to it. These concepts were further reinforced by courses DAT-220 Fundamentals of Data Mining and CS-340 Client/Server Development. We had to work with the databases to pull the correct data and display it to the user. The course work provided us with knowledge of data analysis and manipulation. The CS-340 class had us develop a G.U.I. for the user to interact with data.
### Security

The Computer Science program also had us working to ensure that our code is secure. CS-320 Software Test, Automation, and Q.A. had us develop unit tests to check our code. CS-405 Secure Coding took testing and checking our code a step further by using CPPCheck to search for vulnerabilities in the code and implementing a better solution to fix the security. The course taught us how to use the tools to find the problems and develop a software development policy that a company would use for the team to adhere to and follow.

### Category One Enhancement - Software Design and Engineering
The first artifact in my portfolio:[ Artifact 1 - Jeremy Huesman.zip](https://github.com/jhues97/jhues97.github.io/blob/a30dd3b6e1ae3015fd757c4236b1fe85b4b53077/Artifact%201%20-%20Jeremy%20Huesman.zip), is the 3D scene I created for course CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. The project showcases the software and design skills of the Computer Science program. The user can move about the 3D environment and see the objects from all angles. We learned how to apply textures to our objects so that they would replicate the object correctly. There were improvements and enhancements made to this project. I fixed the lighting and got it working correctly which I ran into issues with during the coursework. I also improved the controls to make movement smoother and easier to control for the user.

### Category Two Enhancement - Algorithms and Data Structure
The second artifact in my portfolio: [Artifact 2 - Jeremy Huesman](https://github.com/jhues97/jhues97.github.io/blob/b7a8d17d93fc538dddf2f763bb0bc9481ece0382/Artifact%202%20-%20Jeremy%20Huesman.zip), is the binary search tree from CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms. The search tree uses nodes to search the CSV file to display and sort bids pulled from the CSV file. The enhancements I made to this project were to give the user more options for working with the dataset. I also worked to find the best way to have the file loaded to pull the information requested that was the most efficient. During the courses, we learned that making our code as efficient as possible is what we should strive to accomplish.

### Category Three Enhancement - Databases
The third artifact in my portfolio: [Artifact 3 - Jeremy Huesman](https://github.com/jhues97/jhues97.github.io/blob/09e3ba95f229f93b048c616d43275ecc8724f2a0/Artifact%203%20-%20Jeremy%20Huesman.zip), is the project from DAD-220 Introduction to Structured Database Environments. The project helps showcase the database knowledge I gained throughout the degree program. The artifact ran basic C.R.U.D functions on the database and helped get us familiar with creating statements to pull the required information. To enhance this artifact, I had to recreate the database in a virtual machine that I created with Ubuntu and installed MySQL on. Once created, I added more information about athletes and ran queries to pull the information. I ran a variety of queries and joined the information together to display it to the user.
